The topic Enhanced Prediction of Passenger Flow for the New Chennai Metro Line Based on Ticket Price, Distance, 
and Socioeconomic Factors focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate passenger flow with high accuracy. 
This model aims to assist in strategic planning, ticket pricing, and optimizing operations for the new Chennai metro line.
By leveraging data from multiple sources, including historical ridership data, survey responses, geospatial information, and socioeconomic metrics, 
the study integrates diverse factors that influence metro usage. Key variables include ticket price, travel distance, nearby transport options, population density, 
and economic indicators such as income levels and affordability.The methodology involves collecting and preprocessing data, engineering relevant features, 
and training machine learning models like Gradient Boosting Regressors and Random Forest Regressor to establish predictive relationships. 
The model will be validated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to ensure accuracy and robustness. 
The outputs will include passenger flow predictions, insights into the impact of pricing and distance on ridership, 
and identification of high-demand areas to guide service planning.This study addresses challenges like data quality, 
dynamic external factors, and behavioural variability while emphasizing the importance of incorporating socioeconomic
and spatial data for a holistic analysis. Ultimately, the enhanced prediction model aims to provide actionable insights, 
helping stakeholders optimize metro operations, set competitive pricing, and improve accessibility for Chennai's growing urban population.
